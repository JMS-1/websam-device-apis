# WebSAM Device APIs

This Repo is meant to contain the APIs for everything that is intended to run on ZERA devices in the long run. This includes, but isn't limited to, Sources, Refernece Meters, Error Calulators. Currently, these are all part of one API, but different controllers.

The existing implementations wrap old interfaces to the devices mentiond above or simulate their behaiviour.

This repository is primarily meant to be used as a submodule to other projects, namely [WebSAM](https://github.com/ZeraGmbH/websam) and [ZENUX](https://github.com/ZeraGmbH/meta-zera).
